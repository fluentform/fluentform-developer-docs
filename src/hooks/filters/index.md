Fluent Forms has many interesting filer hooks that let developers change default settings and even extend Fluent Forms with new functionality.

## What are Filter Hooks

A hook is a feature that allows developers to manipulate functionality without modifying core files. A hook can help developers inject some functions or edit default settings.
  
Filter hooks are used to return modified values for certain parameters, based on different factors.
